## intent:user_description
- I am ambitious and driven. I thrive on challenge and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive toward. I’m not comfortable with settling, and I’m always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness. In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.
- Well, I’m currently an [account executive](job_title) at Smith, where I handle our top performing client. Before that, I worked at an agency where I was on three different major national healthcare brands. And while I really enjoyed the work that I did, I’d love the chance to dig in much deeper with one specific healthcare company, which is why I’m so excited about this opportunity with Metro Health Center
- I am highly organized. I always take notes, and I use a series of tools to help myself stay on top of deadlines. I like to keep a clean workspace and create a logical filing method so I’m always able to find what I need. I find this increases efficiency and helps the rest of the team stay on track, too. In my last role, I created a new filing process that increased departmental efficiency 25%.
- I am results-oriented, constantly checking in with the goal to determine how close or how far away we are and what it will take to make it happen. I find this pressure inspiring and a great motivator for the rest of the team. In fact, over the past year, I was able to help my team shorten our average product time to market by two weeks.
- My name is [Susan Klein](name) and I am a [Product Manager](job_title) at Company XYZ. I live in [Dakar] location. I have previously worked as an Assistant Product Manager at both Company ABC and Company DEF. I’ve done a Degree in Product Management.Out of my 8-year work experience, my greatest accomplishment has been to design, test and launch products in two foreign markets three months ahead of schedule and 25% under budget.I have made it my personal goal to take time to build solid long lasting business relationships with international suppliers, vendors and partners.
- I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and coming up with solutions in a timely manner. I thrive in team settings, and I think my skill in effectively communicating with others is what drives my ability to solve a variety of problems.
- I’m an innovative [HR manager](job_title) with 8 years of experience managing all aspects of the HR function — from recruiting to training to benefits — for Fortune 500 companies.
- I have spent the last six years developing my skills as a [customer service manager](job_title) for Megacompany Inc., where I have won several performance awards and been promoted twice. I love managing teams and solving customer problems.
- I’ve been working in marketing for the last two years since graduating from Cornell and I love it.I’m currently working as a [marketing coordinator](job_title) at a fashion e-commerce startup.
- Well. I’ve been working for the past six years as a [business systems analyst](job_title) and [data manager](job_title). During that time I’ve been trained and certified on a number of different software platforms and systems
- I'd really describe myself as a person with a versatile skill-set, a lot of integrity and a willingness to go the extra mile to satisfy a customer. Perhaps the best way to let you know what I'm about is to share with you a quick experience I had.
- So my name is [Joe](name) and I am [27](age) years old. For the past 5 years, I’ve been working as a [business analyst](job_title) at Company X and Y.I have some background in data analysis, with a degree from University XY. What really got me into the field, though, is the internship I did at Company Z. Throughout my career, I’ve noticed that I’ve always been good with numbers and handling data.Moving forward, I hope to expand my experience across different industries. Particularly fintech, which is why I’m interested in your company..
- I've been an tech-focused [project manager](job_title) for up to 8 years now.I graduated from University X, where I made the Dean’s List, with a major in business administration and a minor in computer science. After that, I first got into the industry working as an administrative assistant at Company X. There I provided clerical support with interdepartmental communication, helped in managing schedules, and maintained the digital filing system.After that, I was working as a project manager for Company Y that provided cloud computing solutions for about 6 years. There, I personally managed 5+ teams of software projects, and made sure everything went smoothly in terms of business goals, deadlines, budget, and more
- I recently graduated from University X with a B.A. in international business. While there, I learned a lot of theory in subjects like corporate communication, international economics, corporate governance, and more. I was also part of the student government, and maintained a GPA of 3.6.I’ve worked hard in my education and now I’m ready to apply my knowledge into practice.

## intent:user_background
- I’m an avid movie buff, which is why I attended film school at UCLA. I love everything about working as a [production assistant](job_title), knowing that I’m playing my part in creating films that will bring people joy. While I’m content to be where I am now, I do dream of one day becoming a location scout.
- ​I started my career in [Marketing](job_title) after graduating with a Business degree in 2013. I’ve spent my entire career at Microsoft, receiving two promotions and three awards for outstanding performance. I’m looking to join a smaller company now, and take on more leadership and project management.
- I graduated with a Business degree in 2010, and was offered an [account management](job_title) position from a telecommunications company I had interned with. I loved working with customers and managing and growing my accounts, but the industry we were in just wasn’t very appealing to me. After that, I stayed a full year and learned a ton about how to build and manage accounts successfully and  I ended up becoming a top performer in my group before leaving.
- My last job was at Sephora, where I was in charge of the West Coast marketing team. We designed customer attraction and retention plans beginning from the market research stage. Our 2017 goal was a 2% revenue increase over 2016 and we got 3%.
- I’m an innovative [software engineer](job_title) with 20 years of experience managing all aspects of the development process for small to medium-sized companies
- I'm a [Support Specialist](job_title) at Lucent Lighting now. I handle everything after the initial sale – the ordering, troubleshooting, invoicing, etc. Before that I was a voiceover artist and I had my own company
- My first job was as an [administrative assistant](job_title) for Macy’s in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I learned a great deal in that role that served me well over the next 12 years. At the time, I wasn’t sure about my career path, so I next took a position selling real estate. It only lasted for six months, but I sure enjoyed it.
- Well, I’ve always been interested in tech.But it all probably started when I was a kid, and at the age of 9 I first got my computer.I always loved playing around with code and learning new things. But it wasn’t until that high school where I first had my first class about it that really made me fall in love with the subject.Since then, I started learning more about it and decided to major in IT at University X.
- I have spent five years as an [executive assistant](job_title) with Wiler, Inc. in administrative support roles. As the current executive assistant to the CFO, I frequently collaborate with other administrative assistants to perform calendar management, coordinate international travel and assemble research reports for the financial specialists in our six offices around the world. At the beginning of last year, I optimized our email filtering system to improve office communication and reduce the amount of missed messages by 28%. I understand that your company depends a lot on email communication, so I want to use my organizational abilities to achieve faster communication processes in this office
- I have 10 years of experience in personal [finance management](job_title), and I have assisted 45 repeat clients in increasing their capital by an average of 15% every year. As a financial analyst, I utilized visual growth charts to show my clients how each saving plan option can impact their goals. When I became a senior financial analyst, I supervised other analysts and trained them in providing the most helpful experience to our customers. As your senior financial consultant, I aim to integrate my individualized approach to helping clients build the retirement fund they will depend on
- My experience includes a variety of marketing and advertising opportunities. In college, I was the ad intern at the local radio station, where I designed event posters for local concerts and music festivals. Then I worked as a market research assistant, analyzing consumer data and drafting reports for the marketing director. My other positions allowed me to practice applying research to writing ad copy, social media posts and a few radio commercial scripts. As a [social media specialist](job_title), I would want to continue sharing my research insights and improving my ability to transform consumer data into actionable, engaging content
- After graduating from high school in Basking Ridge, NJ, I decided to attend the University of Notre Dame. I chose Notre Dame because of the school’s strong academics and strong athletics. Having lettered in three sports in high school all four years, I wanted a school where students pack the stadiums but also take academics seriously. Notre Dame was the perfect choice for me.
- When working for my last company I learned a great deal about prioritizing. Up until that point I’d never had to deal with so much paperwork in my life- and it came as a bit of a shock at first how much had to be done in such a short period of time on top of my other duties. However- I was able to sort through the massive stack of work to be done and select what information was needed right away and what could wait a little longer. In the end prioritizing my workload became second nature- and is now something I do out of habit.
- While working at Walmart I learned a great deal about dealing with customers and how to handle difficult requests from those who might be a bit irritated when approaching me. I learned that keeping a cool head during confrontation is a must- and that arguing back with anyone in a professional setting doesn’t help solve anything. In the end it’s just a matter of keeping a clear mind and professional demeanor and helping your clients and customers to the best of your ability- despite the mood they might be in. This is an excellent skill that I know will be useful in this position and can help me make your customers happy and willing to come back over and over again.
- In my job I’m required to update my technical skill set on an ongoing basis. However, some of the technical skills are not ones I can fully address within our internal training programs. As an example, there is a software program we have begun using in my work where I needed additional training. I made a request to my boss to do some off-hours training online and she OKed it, so I’ve already begun taking the classes and will be ready to complete the certification exam next month
- My major skills are in the area of prototype designing for racing cars. I am an expert in designing and supervising the creation of real life molds for racing cars. Two years ago I headed the design project for a custom made, aerodynamic, twin turbo race car that went on to win the world championship Series XYZ race
- I have a PhD in this field- which you can see from reading my resume. I also have five years of experience teaching university-level courses- and I have published two texts on the subject. I feel I am qualified for this position because of my dedication to the industry and my record of high achievement. I am a goal-setter and a list-maker- and when I have an idea- I move mountains in order to accomplish my goals- especially in the workplace. If hired- I anticipate helping your company set and achieve goals that will shatter all of your previous sales records. In addition to being a driven professional- I also enjoy cultivating strong bonds within the workplace- which helps everyone look forward to showing up for work each day
- I have over 10 years of experience working in management in this field. What isn’t stated there is that I was one of the founders of the company and my sales skills grew it from a start-up all the way to its first public offering. The skills I used to do this have been further honed- and I anticipate being able to do great things for your company as well. In addition to having sharp business acumen- I relate well to my colleagues and clients and pride myself on being an excellent communicator- which helps foster a stress-free environment for everyone.
- I am efficient in a number of programming languages including HTML, C++, Java and AppleScript. I have generated over 100% excess revenue for two separate companies through cost cutting programming efficiency, and I have leadership experience with a team of five IT professionals working on some of the popular iPhone apps online. As far as weakness is concerned I have a tendency to remain quiet in meetings, but I am working on speaking up when I feel I have ideas to share.
- As a technical project manager, I have more than six years of experience at top Wall Street Companies. In recent company, I led the development of an award winning new trading platform. I am a person that survives in a fast-paced environment. At moment, I am looking for a chance to apply my technical expertize and my creative problem solving skills at an innovative software company like this one
- Well, I don’t know the other people you’re interviewing, so I can’t say that I’m your “best” candidate. However, I can say that I would be able to hit the ground running and, as I did for my previous employer, provide immediate results for you. During my first quarter with ABC Pharmaceuticals, I ranked as the #1 sales person in the southeastern region, using my knowledge of medical terminology and the formulary system to increase our client base by 40%
- My education has focused on not only learning the fundamentals, but also on the practical application of the information learned within those classes. For example, I played a lead role in a class project where we gathered and analyzed best practice data from this industry. Let me tell you more about the results.Focus on specific behavioral examples supporting the key competencies for the job. Then ask if they would like to hear more examples.
- I worked at a small shop for two years doing 50 projects a year, meeting 100% of my deadlines. Then I worked for a bigger firm with clients like Disney and Netflix—with 99% client satisfaction. I collaborated with the team to win an A’ Design Award. I’m excited to step into a role like this that’s designed around that kind of efficiency and collaboration
